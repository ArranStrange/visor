# Fix image transition with slider movement (2025-06-25 15:03Z)

The change of image doesn't keep up with the slider.

I can see the issue with the BeforeAfterSlider component. The problem is that the `clipPath` transition is causing a delay between the slider movement and the image reveal. The transition property on the before image is making the clipping change smooth, but it's not keeping up with the real-time slider movement.

Let me fix this by removing the transition and ensuring the image clipping updates immediately with the slider position:

I will remove the transition property from the before image's clipPath to make the image reveal keep up with the slider movement in real-time.

          }}
        />
```

</details>

Perfect! I've removed the `transition: "clip-path 0.1s"` property from the before image. This was causing a 0.1-second delay between when the slider moved and when the image clipping updated, making it feel like the image wasn't keeping up with the slider.

Now the `clipPath` will update immediately as the slider moves, providing a smooth and responsive before/after comparison experience. The image reveal should now perfectly match the slider position in real-time.
