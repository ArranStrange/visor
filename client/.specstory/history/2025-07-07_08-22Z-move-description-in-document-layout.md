_**User**_

lets move the description above the tags but below the title.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you move the description above the tags but below the title in the PresetDetail.tsx file.

Now I need to remove the duplicate description that appears later in the file:

Perfect! I've successfully moved the description to appear above the tags but below the title. The changes I made:

1. **Added the description** right after the title and edit menu, but before the tags section
2. **Removed the duplicate description** that was appearing later in the file after the Before/After images

Now the layout flows as:
1. Creator information
2. Title & edit menu
3. **Description** (newly positioned)
4. Tags
5. Before/After images
6. Accordion sections

The description now appears in a more logical position - right after the title where users would expect to see it, but before the tags which are more of a categorization element.

lets put the creators notes in a dropdown like filmsimdetail

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you move the creator's notes into a dropdown accordion like in the FilmSimDetail page. Let me update the PresetDetail.tsx file to match that structure.

Perfect! I've successfully updated the PresetDetail.tsx file to move the creator's notes into a dropdown accordion that matches the structure used in FilmSimDetail.tsx. 

The changes include:

1. **Replaced the simple notes section** with an accordion dropdown
2. **Added the same styling and structure** as the FilmSimDetail page
3. **Included the creator's avatar and username** in the notes section, making it clickable to navigate to their profile
4. **Added proper fallback text** ("No notes provided.") when there are no notes
5. **Maintained the same visual hierarchy** and spacing

Now the creator's notes will appear in a collapsible accordion section that users can expand to read, keeping the interface clean and organized while providing easy access to the creator's additional information and context about the preset.
