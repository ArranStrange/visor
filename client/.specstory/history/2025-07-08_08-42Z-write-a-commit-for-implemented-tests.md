_**Assistant**_

I'll help you write a commit message for the tests you've implemented. Let me first examine the test files to understand what tests have been created.

Based on my analysis of the test files, I can see that you've implemented a comprehensive set of Cypress end-to-end tests for the VISOR application. Here's a commit message that captures the scope and nature of these tests:

```
feat: implement comprehensive Cypress E2E test suite

Add extensive end-to-end testing coverage for VISOR application with 6 test suites:

- Home page tests: Content loading, filters, responsive design
- Navigation tests: Page routing, browser navigation, state persistence  
- Search functionality: Basic search, filters, empty results, special characters
- Upload system: Preset/film sim uploads, validation, file handling, progress
- Preset detail page: Content display, interactions, downloads, comments
- Film simulation detail: Mocked data testing, UI interactions, responsive design

Key features:
- Custom Cypress commands for common operations (waitForPageLoad, viewportPreset)
- GraphQL query mocking for consistent test data
- Responsive design testing across mobile/tablet/desktop viewports
- File upload testing with fixtures (test-image.jpg, test-preset.xmp)
- Error handling and edge case coverage
- Data-cy selectors for reliable element targeting

Tests cover core user workflows including content browsing, search, upload, 
and detailed content viewing with proper error states and responsive behavior.
```

This commit message follows conventional commit format and provides a comprehensive overview of the test implementation, highlighting the key areas covered and the technical approach used.

_**User**_

I think our project has changed so much since we started. maybe we should write a new README.md?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! Let me first examine the current README to understand what needs to be updated, then I'll help you create a comprehensive new README that reflects the current state of your VISOR project.
