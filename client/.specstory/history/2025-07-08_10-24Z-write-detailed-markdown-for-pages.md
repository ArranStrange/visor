I'll analyze the codebase to understand all the pages and create detailed markdown documentation for each one. Let me start by exploring the pages directory and understanding the structure.

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/pages â€¢ **19** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ğŸ“„ `FilmSimDetail.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `Upload.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `Login.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `Home.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `SearchView.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `PresetDetail.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `UploadPreset.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `Notifications.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `Discussions.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `DiscussionDetail.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `UploadFilmSim.tsx` |

| ğŸ“„ `Profile.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `CreateList.tsx` |
| ğŸ“„ `Register.tsx` |

</details>

Now let me examine each page to understand their functionality and create detailed documentation. I'll start with the simpler pages and work my way up to the more complex ones.
