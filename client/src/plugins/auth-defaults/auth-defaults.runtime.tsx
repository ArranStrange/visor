/**
 * Auth Pages Default Plugins
 * 
 * This runtime file registers default Auth page sections.
 * Plugins can override or extend these by using different priorities.
 * 
 * Note: Auth routes (login, register, email verification) are simple forms
 * that may not need extensive plugin support. This structure allows for
 * future extensibility if needed.

// Auth slots can be added here if needed in the future
// Current implementation keeps existing functionality intact
