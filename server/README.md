# VISOR – Curate, Share, and Discover Creative Looks

VISOR is a web platform designed for photographers and visual creatives to **share Lightroom presets**, **explore film simulation recipes**, and **build a curated personal toolkit** of styles. Whether you're chasing the look of a vintage Fujifilm stock or refining your golden hour tones, VISOR helps you discover and manage the tools that shape your aesthetic.

## What is VISOR?

VISOR is more than just a preset manager. It's a place for photographers to:

- Browse and upload **Lightroom `.xmp` presets**
- Explore and share **Fujifilm film simulation recipes**
- Search and filter by mood, colour, camera, or use case
- Save favourites into curated **personal or public lists**
- View **before/after previews** and real-world image examples
- Read detailed **setting breakdowns**, creator notes, and camera compatibility
- Comment, react, and connect with others in the community

VISOR is built to be **clean, dark, and mobile-friendly**, with a strong visual focus and modern photographer-first design.

## Why VISOR?

Creative tools should be just that—**creative**. Existing platforms for presets and film sims are often either too commercial, too technical, or not designed for inspiration and sharing.

VISOR aims to become a home for:

- Curious newcomers exploring visual styles
- Enthusiasts replicating film looks digitally
- Professionals refining or sharing their signature tones
- Communities building **open, expressive collections** of visual tools
